    <h1 style="color:red">What is OCaml?</h1>
    <h4>OCaml is a general purpose programming language developed mainly by Xavier Leroy. It has a focus on readability
      and offers both functional and imperative features.</h4>
    <br>
    <h1 style="color:red">Why use OCaml?</h1>
    <h4>What makes OCaml unique is its powerful static type system and type inference. This allows for a
    faster compile time and increased safety since it checks for mismatched types, along with saving
    the user time by not requiring them to make explicit type declarations. In addition, OCaml uses pattern matching
    which makes it easier to create recursive functions with less code and increase processing speed. These factors
    make OCaml a highly responsive language that is useful for tasks that require quick responses, most notable finance.
    Companies that implement OCaml at an industrial level include Jane Street and Facebook.</h4>
    <br>
    <h1 style="color:red">Why don't more people use OCaml?</h1>
    <h4>OCaml is not a beginner friendly language, using syntax that is hard to pick up as a novice programmer.
    In addition, it offers very few basic types which creates unnecessary layers of boxing. Because of this, OCaml
    isn't used by many programmers, which has led to a limited variety of libraries with poor documentation compared to
    most other languages.</h4>
